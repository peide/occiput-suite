===============================================================================

            Occiput - Suite for Tomographic Vision - version 0.5

===============================================================================

Tomographic reconstruction software for PET, PET-MRI and SPECT in 2D, 3D (volumetric) and 4D (spatio-temporal) in Python.

The software provides high-speed reconstruction using Graphics Processing Units (GPU). **Note**: an NVidia CUDA-compatible GPU is required.

``Occiput`` can be utilized with arbitrary scanner geometries. It can be utilized for abstract tomographic reconstruction experiments to develop new algorithms and explore new system geometries, or to connect to real-world scanners, providing production quality image reconstruction with standard algorithms (such as MLEM and OSEM).

``Occiput`` implements advanced algorithms for motion correction, kinetic imaging, multi-modal reconstruction, respiratory and cardiac gated imaging.

The source code contains Jupyter notebooks with examples.

A Python extension package ``Occiput_Interface_Biograph_mMR``, implementing the interface to the Siemens Biograph mMR PET-MRI scanner is available upon request and following authorization from Siemens. Notebooks containing Biograph_mMR in the title can only be executed after installing the extension package.

Installation
============

Linux, Windows (not tested recently), MacOS
-------------------------------------------

Pre-requisites: Occiput requires ``NVidia GPU Drivers``, ``NVidia CUDA`` and the ``NiftyRec`` GPU accelerated tomographic ray-tracing library.

1. `Install NVidia GPU Drivers and CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_

2. `Install NiftyRec libraries <https://github.com/mscipio/NiftyRec>`_ - build the latest version using CMake

3. Make sure that CUDA libraries and NiftyRec libraries are in the system path:

 - **Linux**:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path_to_cuda_libraries:/path_to_niftyrec_libraries

 - **MacOS**:

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path_to_cuda_libraries:/path_to_niftyrec_libraries

 - **Windows**:

    setx path "%path%;c:/path_to_cuda_libraries:/path_to_niftyrec_libraries;"

4. Install ``Occiput Suite`` from the source code available in this repo:

 -    git clone https://github.com/mscipio/occiput-suite.git

 -    python setup.py build install


Getting started
===============
Examples and demos of the features of Occiput are in the /occiput/notebooks folder.
To get started, install ``Python Jupyter`` and open the scripts in
-`/occiput_suite/notebooks <https://github.com/mscipio/occiput-suite/tree/master/occiput_suite/notebooks>`_. 

The notebook `/occiput_suite/notebooks/DOCUMENTATION.ipynb <https://github.com/mscipio/occiput-suite/blob/master/occiput_suite/notebooks/DOCUMENTATION.ipynb>`_ contains an index and short description of the notebooks.
